  # Multiregion options for Zeebe
  #
  ## WARNING: In order to get your multi-region setup covered by Camunda enterprise support you MUST get your configuration and run books reviewed by Camunda before going to production.
  # This is necessary for us to be able to help you in case of outages, due to the complexity of operating multi-region setups and the dependencies to the underlying Kubernetes prerequisites.
  # If you operate this in the wrong way you risk corruption and complete loss of all data especially in the dual-region case.
  # If you can, consider three regions. Please, contact your customer success manager as soon as you start planning a multi-region setup.
  # Camunda reserves the right to limit support if no review was done prior to launch or the review showed significant risks.
  multiregion:
    # number of regions that this Camunda Platform instance is stretched across
    regions: 2
    # unique id of the region. Should start at 0 for easy computation. With 2 regions, you would have region 0 and 1.
